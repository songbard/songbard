- 👋 Hi, I’m @songbard
- 👀 I’m interested in analyzing data about policing, mental health, and related issues.  I used to publish from electronic medical record data and research studies that I led, particularly about diabetes.  I built a computer simulation model of type 2 diabetes and its treatment.  I led studies of the impact of diabetes around the world.
- 🌱 No retired, I’m currently learning R
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cleaning and analyzing Portland Policy Bureau datasets
- 📫 How to reach me ...
