- 👋 Hi, I’m @songbard
- 👀 I’m interested in analyzing data about policing, mental health, race, and related issues.  I used to publish from electronic medical record data and research studies that I led, particularly about diabetes.  I built a computer simulation model of type 2 diabetes and its treatment.  I led studies of the impact of diabetes around the world.
- 🌱 Now retired, I’m currently learning R to analyze policing data
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cleaning and analyzing Portland Policy Bureau datasets, then comparisons among cities
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can email me at jonabrown@gmail.com
